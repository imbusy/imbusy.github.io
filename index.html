          <p>I built a web application called mailguard.io that provided users with an email
             address for specifically receiving and storing receipts. This email address could then
             be used at retail or online stores instead of revealing your personal address.</p>
          <p>The service filtered all other marketing emails and spam out and left only receipts
             so you could quickly access them from one place. However, there were a few problems
             with this idea:
             <ul>
               <li>Often the online shops then use your email address for automatic account
                   creation and password recovery. Do we filter the password recovery emails or
                   keep them?</li>
               <li>There were few opportunities for organic growth in usage of the service. After
                   the initial registration spike of my friends, neither registration, nor usage
                   actually picked up.</li>
             </ul>After running the service for six weeks, I decided to shut it down.
          </p>
          <p>On the other hand, I was happy that I had an opportunity to try out the Google Cloud
             Platform for the first time and play with some cool technologies. Screenshots of the
             web interface are below.

          <p>At one point, I was living in a San Francisco studio and I did not have enough space
             for a desktop monitor on my table. However, I needed more computing power than my
             laptop could provide so I decided to buy a desktop computer, hide it somewhere and
             connect to it remotely through the home network.</p>
          <p>It was not easy to find the right solution for remote desktop streaming so I wrote
             a survey article of all the solutions I had tried myself. The article is on
             medium.com:

          <p>As my Uber for [x] idea in 2014, I built a package delivery service.</p>
          <p>The idea was to tap into the Eastern Europe to UK package delivery market. There are
             a lot of packages moving west in unofficial looking vans together with people
             travelling to and from the UK on a budget. I wanted to make the search for a delivery
             company and actual pick-up coordination easier.</p>
          <p>I spent a couple of months building a web application that fit the consumers who have
             packages and package delivery companies providing the service. I scraped local
             classified ads and built up a reasonable list of companies and their delivery
             locations. I had a fully working product.</p>
          <p>The front page was a form that asked for your package information, such as
             the dimensions, and the destination address. The application could then search a
             geographical database based on the destination for companies that can deliver. On
             the package delivery company side, there was a profile where you could enter details
             about yourself and draw polygons of delivery locations.</p>
          <p>It seemed to work and we did end up matching some customers with drivers and packages
             were delivered. However, there was still some human coordination and it was difficult
             to find reliable drivers. One idea was to build stronger partnerships with a filtered
             set of drivers. I did not have enough resources at the time to pursue the
             project further and I was living on the other side of the world so this project had to
             end.</p>

          <p>My thesis for the degree of MPhil in Applied Mathematics has finally been accepted.
             The title is "Iterative Methods for Solving Systems of Linear Equations: Hyperpower,
             Conjugate Gradient and Monte Carlo Methods". It is mostly about detecting and
             correcting errors in large scale computations caused by cosmic particles hitting CPU
             logic gates.</p>

          <p>I finally finished the first version of a web application for solving multiple retail
             logistics problems:
            <ul>
              <li>Optimal work assignment and route planning for delivery drivers.</li>
              <li>Tracking of visual appeal and presence of goods in store shelves.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>For the first problem, there is a web UI for uploading the available work for the day.
             Once the work is uploaded, an optimization algorithm (k-means with some constraints
             and other heuristics) is executed to provide a possible solution to the travelling
             salesman problem. Afterwards, the human can adjust the work assignment and print out
             worksheets for drivers.</p>
          <p>For the second problem there is a web UI for assigning stores to sales representatives
             who occasionally visit the retail locations. Then the sales representatives use an
             Android application for checking into stores based on their GPS coordinates, upload
             photos of goods in shelves and mark the quantity of each item still available. Once
             uploaded to the server, all of this data is available for further analysis in web
             reports.</p>
          <p>This solution is currently used to manage thousands of locations and was being updated
             until 2017. A version of the landing page, although slightly outdated, is available

          <p>For something not related to computers, here is a bike restoration project. This was a
             bicycle that I received for my 11th birthday, I believe. It was starting to rust, the
             brakes would not work and overall it just needed attention. I diassembled the whole
             bicycle, sanded it down, repainted, lubricated what needs lubricating again and
             replaced some of the essential parts.</p>
          <p>Then, a couple of months later, it was stolen. I am sure it has a different color now.

          <p>There was no central theme, but it did have some neat effects and a lot of the scenes
             were synchronized to music through frequency analysis. Also, I played around with
             advanced shadow mapping techniques.</p>
          <p>I think there is some issue with the lower frequencies in the audio file so if you
             want to see it yourself, go easy on the volume:

          <p>This was my first demo that I presented at a demoparty at Assembly 2006. It placed
             9th out of 14, which is a good result for the first attempt, I think. In addition, I
             was later awarded the prestigious 2006 scene.org award for Breakthrough Performance.

          <p>Interesting fact: during development, I found an Intel graphics driver bug, which is
             supposed to be very rare. I have not hit a driver bug since.</p>

          <p>I had spent most of my time developing "game engines" or essentially working on
             low-level graphics functionality and never really building any actual game. So once
             I decided to use the simplest graphics libraries to make an actual game as quickly and
             effortlessly as I could.</p>
          <p>I decided to make a 2D side-scrolling and shooting game. You play as a hero, who walks
             and jumps around the room shooting zombies. Nothing fancy, but it was something
             playable and possibly enjoyable.</p>
          <p>I can think of a 100 ways I could improve the game today, but it is a part of history
             now.</p>
          <p>The game runs in Windows and can be downloaded <a href="files/run_game.exe">here</a>.
