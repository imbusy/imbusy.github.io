        <p>Currently I am available for remote contract work as I travel across the

          <p>I have left on a tour of the United States in my travel trailer. You can follow my
             journey on <a href="https://www.lukas.travel">www.lukas.travel</a>. The content for
             the blog is created by me and my wife and mostly there is no distinction.</p>
          <p>I have left my full time position at the Voleon hedge fund as a software engineer and
             now I am available for remote hire. I have noticed that I am significantly more
             productive working fewer hours per day and as a contractor I am always motivated to do
             my best work for the client.</p>

          <p>I built a web application called mailguard.io that provided users with an email
             address for specifically receiving and storing receipts. This email address could then
             be used at retail or online stores instead of revealing your personal address.</p>
          <p>The service filtered all other marketing emails and spam out and left only receipts
             so you could quickly access them from one place. However, there were a few problems
             with this idea:
             <ul>
               <li>Often the online shops then use your email address for automatic account                                 creation and password recovery. Do we filter the password recovery emails or
                   keep them?</li>
               <li>There were few opportunities for organic growth in usage of the service. After
                   the initial registration spike of my friends, neither registration, nor usage
                   actually picked up.</li>
             </ul>After running the service for six weeks, I decided to shut it down.
          </p>
          <p>On the other hand, I was happy that I had an opportunity to try out the Google Cloud
             Platform for the first time and play with some cool technologies. Screenshots of the
             web interface are below.

          <p>At one point, I was living in a San Francisco studio and I did not have enough space
             for a desktop monitor on my table. However, I needed more computing power than my
             laptop could provide so I decided to buy a desktop computer, hide it somewhere and
             connect to it remotely through the home network.</p>
          <p>It was not easy to find the right solution for remote desktop streaming so I wrote
             a survey article of all the solutions I had tried myself. The article is on
             medium.com:

          <p>As my Uber for [x] idea in 2014, I built a package delivery service.</p>
          <p>The idea was to tap into the Eastern Europe to UK package delivery market. There are
             a lot of packages moving west in unofficial looking vans together with people
             travelling to and from the UK on a budget. I wanted to make the search for a delivery
             company and actual pick-up coordination easier.</p>
          <p>I spent a couple of months building a web application that fit the consumers who have
             packages and package delivery companies providing the service. I scraped local
             classified ads and built up a reasonable list of companies and their delivery
             locations. I had a fully working product.</p>
          <p>The front page was a form that asked for your package information, such as
             the dimensions, and the destination address. The application could then search a
             geographical database based on the destination for companies that can deliver. On
             the package delivery company side, there was a profile where you could enter details
             about yourself and draw polygons of delivery locations.</p>
          <p>It seemed to work and we did end up matching some customers with drivers and packages
             were delivered. However, there was still some human coordination and it was difficult
             to find reliable drivers. One idea was to build stronger partnerships with a filtered
             set of drivers. I did not have enough resources at the time to pursue the
             project further and I was living on the other side of the world so this project had to
             end.</p>
