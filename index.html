        <p>This page is a description of my more notable personal projects. The page has gone
           through many iterations since 2004 and the projects have obviously grown in complexity
           and sophistication.</div>
        <p>Currently I am available for remote contract work as I travel across the
           United States. If you want to follow my journey, see
           <a href="https://www.lukas.travel">www.lukas.travel</a>. If you have a project in mind,
           do not hesitate to contact me at imbusy _ imbusy.org (you know what _ stands for).</p>
